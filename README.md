# Pravah-AI-Powered-Smart-Traffic-Management-System
Traffic jams happen because most traffic signal
lights still use old-fashioned timers, usually stuck on a fixed
60 or 90-second loop. These signals can’t “see” the actual
flow of cars, leading to long queues, unnecessary waits,
increased CO2 emissions and wasted time for commuters. This
paper introduces PRAVAH1 , a three-layered system designed
to get cities moving again. Layer-1 uses smart cameras to
identify different types of vehicles and change lights instantly
based on real-time demand. Layer-2 uses an artificial “brain”
that learns from past patterns to predict and prevent traffic
jams before they even form. Notably, this layer is location-
sensitive, clearing paths for schools and hospitals on priority.
Layer-3 includes a mobile app that helps drivers pick the
best time to leave home, balancing traffic across the whole
city. Our tests show that PRAVAH achieves an aggregated
operational efficiency improvement of approximately 50%,
increases ambulance throughput by 26%, and reduces city-
wide CO2 emissions by 10.5%.
